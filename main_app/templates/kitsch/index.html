  <p class="page-content" >
    At Kitsch Cache Licensing Collective, our goal is to bring together licensing partnerships with the following key ideals:
  </p>
  
  <h3>Ethics > money:</h3>
  <p>
    American Culture includes many unique characters, artists, art forms and brands with loyal fan followings. The fans deserve the highest quality merchandise.
  There are numerous ways of reaching niche markets: web stores, gift stores, comic book stores, regional specialized chains and more. The key is understanding the customer and their shopping habits.
  Licensed merchandise is an important element in the creation of culture, through stories in a variety of mediums, art, music. Some of this is mainstream, but much of this is not.
  Honesty is the foundation of long term relationships.
  Teamwork. Real teamwork. We formed our collective so that we could build our dream team.
